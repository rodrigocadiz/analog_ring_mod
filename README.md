# Ring Modulator

## Overview

----- 

## Software Installation

The software for the Ring Modulator project is developed to be used with PlatformIO, an open source ecosystem for IoT development. To get started with PlatformIO, you can follow the installation guide here:

- [PlatformIO Installation Guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html)

Once PlatformIO is installed, you can clone this repository and open the firmware folder project within PlatformIO IDE.

## Hardware Design

The hardware for the Ring Modulator is developed using Autodesk Eagle. This provides a robust framework for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) that are crucial for our project. You can find the hardware design files in the `hardware` directory of this repository.

For those new to Autodesk Eagle, you can learn more and get started with your designs here:
