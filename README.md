# Ring Modulator

## Overview

In this paper, we present a device that implements a ring modulator intended to recreate historical analog audio. As simple as it sounds, the multiplication of two analog audio signals is not a straightforward task, mainly due to phenomena such as saturation or non-linearity. Drawing inspiration from historical realizations of ring modulation, we experimented with the most common methods described in the literature. Our device, which is comparatively inexpensive, improves upon the aforementioned alternatives from a DIY perspective. It is predominantly analog, adhering to the practices of the first decades of electroacoustic music, with the notable exception of the digital control for the sinusoidal carrier. We aim to strike a balance between analog audio technology and modern components and techniques. Additionally, this paper includes audio-visual demonstrations that showcase the practical uses of our ring modulator. A comprehensive GitHub repository provides open access to all the resources required for DIY enthusiasts to replicate our implementation.

## Software Installation

The software for the Ring Modulator project is developed to be used with PlatformIO, an open source ecosystem for IoT development. To get started with PlatformIO, you can follow the installation guide here:

- [PlatformIO Installation Guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html)

Once PlatformIO is installed, you can clone this repository and open the firmware folder project within PlatformIO IDE.

## Hardware Design

The hardware for the Ring Modulator is developed using Autodesk Eagle. This provides a robust framework for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) that are crucial for our project. You can find the hardware design files in the `hardware` directory of this repository.
